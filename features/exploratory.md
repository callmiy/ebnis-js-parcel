** Save entries with date and datetime data types with the data as created and updated at, but such that the earliest date/datetime is used e.g. if an experience has start and end, where start comes earlier than end, then start will be used as createdAt and updatedAt. This is to capture situtuations where an experience is created later than when it actually happened so we we add feature to show all entries by recency, we would have captured the situtuation accurately.

** Show all entries by recency.
